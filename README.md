Currently, we deliver two 3D-router models, to be found in the
corresponding folder:

- noc_heter: 3D NoC router with support for heterogeneous integration.
- noc_heter_with_pe: 3D NoC router and PEs for inject uniform random traffic
or from traces with support for heterogeneous integration.
- noc_heter_high_throughput: 3D NoC router with support for heterogeneous
integration and support for high-throughput links, see paper.
- noc_heter_high_throughput_with_pe: 3D NoC router with PE, see above.

For a complete documentation of all architectural details, please contact us
directly. (This is partly the result of the Master thesis "Technology-Aware On-Chip Router 
Architecture for High-Performance 3D SoCs" by Behnam Razi Perjikolaei, 
which cannot be made publicly available.)
